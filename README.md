# License Plate Recognition (LPR) Model
## Capstone Project Component

## Overview
This repository contains a license plate detection and recognition model developed as a component of a larger team-based capstone project. The model is implemented using the Ultralytics YOLO framework and is trained to detect vehicle license plates in images using supervised learning.

The primary goal of this component is to provide a reliable and modular computer vision pipeline for license plate localization, which can be integrated into downstream tasks such as optical character recognition (OCR), vehicle tracking, or traffic analysis systems.

This repository focuses specifically on model training and validation, rather than deployment or end-to-end inference.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on YOLO11n, a lightweight variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of object detection models provided by the Ultralytics library. YOLO models perform object detection as a single-stage process, enabling efficient training and inference while maintaining strong localization accuracy.

A pretrained YOLO11n model (`yolo11n.pt`) is used as the starting point and fine-tuned on a custom license plate dataset.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset follows the standard YOLO directory and annotation format, with separate splits for training, validation, and testing:
```
.
├── train/
│ ├── images/
│ ├── labels/
│ └── labels.cache
├── valid/
│ ├── images/
│ ├── labels/
│ └── labels.cache
├── test/
│ ├── images/
│ └── labels/
├── data.yaml
├── main.py
└── yolo11n.pt
```

- `images/` contain input images.
- `labels/` contain corresponding YOLO-format annotation files.
- `data.yaml` defines dataset paths and class labels.
- `labels.cache` files are automatically generated by Ultralytics to speed up data loading.

## Training and Validation Process
Model training and evaluation are handled through the `main.py` script, which uses the Ultralytics YOLO Python API.

### Training Configuration
- **Epochs:** 100
- **Image size:** 640 × 640
- **Batch size:** 16
- **Device:** CPU (configurable for GPU use)
- **Workers:** 8
- **Optimizer and loss functions:** Managed internally by the Ultralytics framework

The model is trained using the dataset specified in `data.yaml`, and training outputs (including checkpoints and logs) are saved under the `runs/` directory.

### Validation
After training, the model is evaluated on the validation split to compute standard YOLO performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall, mAP). These metrics are printed to the console upon completion.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following key dependency:
- **Ultralytics YOLO** (Python package)

Additional dependencies (e.g., PyTorch) are installed automatically when installing Ultralytics.

## Usage
To train and validate the model, run:
```bash
python main.py
```

Training results and validation outputs will be saved in the `runs/` directory generated by Ultralytics.

## Role Within the Capstone Project

This repository contains a license plate detection model developed as part of a data science capstone project examining the societal impacts, limitations, and risks of large-scale automated surveillance systems.

The project uses supervised machine learning to model license plate detection performance under controlled conditions, enabling systematic analysis of how automated license plate recognition (ALPR) systems behave across varying inputs and assumptions. By focusing on model behavior rather than deployment, the work contributes to broader discussions around algorithmic accountability, civil liberties, and the responsible use of data-driven surveillance technologies.

## Limitations and Notes

- This repository does not include OCR or text extraction from license plates.
- Hyperparameter tuning and architectural decisions rely primarily on Ultralytics defaults.
- The implementation prioritizes reproducibility and clarity over experimental novelty.

This work builds on the [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) framework, which provides pretrained models, training utilities, and evaluation tooling for object detection tasks.
